# Unity-Project-Template

A basic, barebones project template for making Unity prototypes or getting started with tutorials.

The basic project includes a series of: 
* Pre-generated Classes
* Enums
* Scenes
* Materials
* Sprites

And a folder structure to keep it all organised.

## Usage

To make use of this template simply cd to your folder, open git and use:

`git clone https://github.com/Chi-Time/Unity-Project-Template "your-project-name"`

Now you'll have a pre-created project along with it's name which you can then simply open through Unity.
